# Gulp-Starter-Environment

## Lightweight Gulp configuration
This is a super Lightweight developer environment that supports stylus and coffee (Jade in the future!), great for beginners to get their feet wet as they dive into web development!

### Getting Started!
1. Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Then install on the command line ``npm install npm -g`` (if you get an error try using ``sudo npm install npm -g`` instead)

Once they are installed run the following in the command line:

Run ``npm install``
Then ``gulp``

##### TIP!!!
Right now saving any ``.styl`` won't change ``main.styl`` thus gulp won't reload it :( So just save ``main.styl`` every time you change a ``.styl``

Now you are up and running!

### Coming soon!
1. Jade - I love Jade so it's a must for me!
2. CSS Framework - I want to make my own grid and CSS styling for this project also!
3. Lightweight code snippets for beginners!
