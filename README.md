# Gulp-Starter-Environment

## Lightweight Gulp configuration

### Getting Started!
1. Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Then install ``npm install npm -g`` (if you get an error try using doing ``sudo npm install npm -g`` instead)

Once they are installed run the following in the command line:

    Run npm install
    Then gulp

Now you are up and running!

### Coming soon!
1. Jade - I love Jade so it's a must for me!
2. CSS Framework - I want to make my own grid and CSS styling for this project also!
