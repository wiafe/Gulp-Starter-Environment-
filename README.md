# Gulp-Starter-Environment

## Lightweight Gulp configuration

Getting Started!
1. Have npm and node installed

Once they are installed run the following in the command line:

    Run npm install
    Then gulp

Now you are up and running!

### Coming soon!
1. Jade - I love Jade so it's a must for me!
2. CSS Framework - I want to make my own grid and CSS styling for this project also!
